### Summary
My way from accountant to a passionate self-taught programmer

Ever since I was a little kid (computers, video games & mobiles) has been my passion.

I grew up to be an accountant as I also love working with numbers, but this never stopped me from my passion toward technology and software industry, as everyday after work when I get home, I open YouTube and search for everything new about mobiles & mobile Apps.

Not to mention that Iâ€™m a big fan for Mrwhosetheboss channel on YouTube, and I was very inspired by his character and how he is very passionate about what he is doing.

So, one day I realized that I really want to do what I love the most; and I started studying.

First, I started studying all what was related to my current field and more as an account payable: (Excel, Power query, Dax functions, Access, VBA, Dashboards, Power BI)

Then I began to study : (SQL, SQLite3, relational database, Unix shell, Python, Django, PYQT5, QT designer, Conda, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, data cleaning and visualization, scikit learn, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, clustering, statistics, GIT, RegEX, HTML, CSS)

Still on the list to go : (Machine Learing, AI, web scraping, PySpark)
